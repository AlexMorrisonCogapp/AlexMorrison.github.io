In this article, we discuss the solutions that some companies are already building using quantum hardware. Framing these as examples of combinatorics problems, we illustrate their application in four industry verticals: cybersecurity, materials and pharmaceuticals, banking and finance, and advanced manufacturing. While quantum computers are not yet available at the scale needed to solve all of these combinatorics problems, we identify three types of near-term opportunities resulting from advances in quantum computing: quantum-safe encryption, material and drug discovery, and quantum-inspired algorithms.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tagged under: <a href="1238+Cryptography.html">Cryptography</a> </ br><hr /><br /><a href= https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerhuang/2020/12/21/heres-why-quantum-computing-will-not-break-cryptocurrencies/><p>Here&rsquo;s Why Quantum Computing Will Not Break Cryptocurrencies</p></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;2022-03-06 (or before) by   in <a href= forbes.com>forbes.com</a><br /><p>Quantum computing isn't going to suddenly end the security of cryptocurrencies and bitcoin.
